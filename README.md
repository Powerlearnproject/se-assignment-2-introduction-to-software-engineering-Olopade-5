Debugging:

Identifying and fixing defects in the code.
Basic Testing:

Conducting unit tests to ensure individual pieces of code work correctly.
Key Differences:

Scope:

Software engineering encompasses the entire software lifecycle, while traditional programming is mainly concerned with writing and debugging code.
Methodology:

Software engineering uses structured methodologies and processes (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) to manage the development process, whereas traditional programming may not follow a formal process.
Collaboration:

Software engineering involves collaboration among multiple roles (e.g., project managers, designers, testers) to deliver a product, whereas traditional programming might involve a single developer or a small team focused solely on coding.
Quality Assurance:

Software engineering places a strong emphasis on quality assurance through formal testing and validation processes, while traditional programming may rely more on ad-hoc testing.
Maintenance and Evolution:

Software engineering includes ongoing maintenance and evolution of software, recognizing that software must be updated over time. Traditional programming may not explicitly account for these activities.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software engineers to design, develop, test, and deploy software. The SDLC provides a structured approach to software development and includes several phases:

Planning:

Determine the scope, objectives, resources, and timeline for the project. Establish feasibility and create a project plan.
Requirements Analysis:

Gather and document detailed requirements from stakeholders to understand what the software must accomplish.
System Design:

Develop high-level system architecture and detailed design specifications. Create models and prototypes as needed.
Implementation (Coding):

Write the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase translates design documents into a functional software product.
Testing:

Verify that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. Conduct various types of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
Deployment:

Release the software to the production environment. Ensure it is properly configured and users are trained as needed.
Maintenance:

Provide ongoing support and updates to the software. This includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and adapting the software to changes in the environment or requirements.
Evaluation:

Review the project and its outcomes to learn from the experience and improve future processes.
Different SDLC models, such as Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and DevOps, use these phases in different ways, adapting the process to suit the project's needs and complexity.

Key SDLC Models
Waterfall:

A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Best suited for projects with well-defined requirements.
Agile:

An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and customer collaboration. Development is divided into small, manageable iterations or sprints.
Spiral:

Combines iterative development with systematic risk management. Each iteration involves planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.
DevOps:

Integrates development and operations to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and accelerate delivery. Focuses on continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and automation.
